  // Keeping the elm dependency cache mounted in a volume is both a small performance benefit
  // when having rebuilt your container. It also solves a problem with the Elm Language Server.
  // The Elm Language Server uses the dependency cache stored at ~/.elm.
  // However, the elm compiler uses elm-stuff in the mounted directory which keeps timestamps
  // telling the elm compiler whether elm.json changed since it last downloaded dependencies.
  // This data is persisted, but without a volume the ~/.elm dependency cache itself is not
  // persisted, resulting in a corruption of that relationship.
  // The Elm Language Server expects the elm compiler to keep ~/.elm up to date, but because
  // of this failure it will crash continuously when ~/.elm does not store the elm code for
  // the dependencies. This will usually occur every time the container has been rebuilt
  // and is manually fixed by deleting the elm-stuff directory which forces the compiler to
  // redownload dependencies.
  // Adding this volume will preserve the elm cache between rebuilds though, fixing this issue
