There's actually no need for identifying the type of wrong if you're going to the algorithm driller, correct?

Are the AUFs on wrong page and/or driller explanation page properly tested after we remove the parse functions usage in other tests?

Visual test for success and status page happening?

Look through TODOs

Make a tooltip on the perm segment on Wrong Page

Make tooltips for all the terminology etc.
