Make sure some test would fail on a long long string of new cases

To-Figure-Out for doing a preAUF instead of a postAUF for symmetric cases and whether it is considered a new case

Implement (time since last attempt) x TPS weighting for randomness in selecting already learned cases

Make a tooltip on the perm segment on Wrong Page

Make tooltips for all the terminology etc.

Make people select themselves their preferred AUF combination for symmetrical cases

Test it doesn't show NaN in averages when no corrects yet, which will be a very normal case for beginners. Maybe even just don't display those averages until there are corrects

Production tests:
- 404 tests in prod
- Assert no cookies (or other cookie checks?)
- Assert CSRF is set up
- Run the production tests in Edge and Firefox as well for sure

Set up Edge and Firefox tests in CI?

Test that the correct algorithm is saved (if it isn't already done)

Support alternative algs for backside / mirror algs for things such as U perms

Disable algorithm submit button on invalid

Make changePLLAlgorithm also do verification?

Fix space not working in algorithm pick page (probably because we're listening for space on press right?)
