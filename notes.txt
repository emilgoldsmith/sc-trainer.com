There's actually no need for identifying the type of wrong if you're going to the algorithm driller, correct?

Should we just implement a getCurrentTestCase function that just asks the app what the current test case is so we can set the test case much less frequently?

Should we implement a pick algorithm dev function? Upside faster tests, downside more surface area for wrong tests

Are the AUFs on wrong page and/or driller explanation page properly tested after we remove the parse functions usage in other tests?

Visual test for success and status page happening?

Do we test that driller test fails after slow correct as well?

Look through TODOs

ensure all callbacks and navigator overrides are called and otherwise throw error;

Make all the pll algorithms the shortest ones again

Can you throw an error if calling elm ports before page has loaded?
