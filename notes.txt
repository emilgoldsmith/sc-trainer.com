There's actually no need for identifying the type of wrong if you're going to the algorithm driller, correct?

Should we just implement a getCurrentTestCase function that just asks the app what the current test case is so we can set the test case much less frequently?

Should we implement a pick algorithm dev function? Upside faster tests, downside more surface area for wrong tests
